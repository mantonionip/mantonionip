I’m a Front End Web Developer and thinker who builds creative and original digital products in JavaScript and React. With experience working in agile environments, I possess an exceptional work ethic and excellent problem solving skills. My knowledge of accessible and responsive digital products gained from professional development experience and a previous career in TV & Film enable me to merge functionality and UX seamlessly.
