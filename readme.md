# Hi, I'm Sam 👋🏻 🧔🏻

![](https://github.com/mantonionip/mantonionip/blob/main/banner.png)

I’m a Toronto-based Front-End Web Developer and thinker who loves creative challenges. I'm excited by opportunities to experiment and think outside the box. As a former film/video editor, I'm resilient, a creative problem solver, and well-acquainted with collaboration and iteration.
I'm always experimenting and learning – and I bring my love for exploration, problem-solving, and creation to everything I do. I strive to create accessible digital products that bring delightful and seamless user experience. I'm self-motivated and curious life-long learner, who is excited for challenges that come with coding and new technologies.
